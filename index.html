        <p> After much research and reflection, I decided Software Engineering is the new direction I want to take. I looked around, tried some free courses, spoke with a couple different bootcamps, researched the different programs. Once I had decided where I wanted to go I put in my application.  I was accepted to a tech bootcamp and now am a Software Engineering student! Thus far I have taken a few online free courses. They all reviewed HTML and CSS. Part of the prework course for this bootcamp involves JavaScript.  Wow, is that a whole different world! It's quite overwhelming. There is a lot to learn. I don't know what it is that I'm missing but there is something. No matter, I'm excited to get started anyway!</p>

        <p>
            Once accepted to the bootcamp, they sent me the prework. It's actually kinda like the prework to the prework. It is relatively easy as they do a great job of explaining things in simple terms. I'm currently stuck on JavaScript. I know what I want to do...I think...but don't know how to do it and I'm not understanding what I'm reading online. I look forward to having a person to point me in the right direction. There are a couple more weeks til class begins. I'm going to try to get a handle on JavaScript before then!</p>
